# Be-More

The idea for Be-More originally started out as a Quote Generator, but evolved as everything does. Aside from quotes and advice, ChatGPT's API can be used to ask questions about various topics. I also wanted it to look friendly, so I drew inspiration from the BMO character from the Adventure Time cartoon, from which I derived the name for the application. 

The front-end was built with React, the back-end was built with ExpressJS, and the console was tailored with CSS.
